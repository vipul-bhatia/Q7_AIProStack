# Express Authentication Example

This project is an example of how to implement authentication in an Express.js application using bcrypt for password hashing and express-session for session management.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

4) Enter username - user1 
5) Enter password - password123
## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Features

- User login with password hashing and session management.
- SHA-256 hashing is used  for password encryption
- Server-side input validation.
- Session-based user authentication.
- Serving static files.

## Important

This is a demonstration only. In a real application, replace the example user database with a proper database solution.
